## Usage

### Step 1: Add Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/issue-bot.yml`:

```yaml
name: Pollinations Issue Assistant

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  ai-comment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: Cloudcompile/pollinations-issue-assistant@v1
        with:
          model: openai
          referrer: prisimai.github.io
```

### Step 2: Comment Commands

You can trigger the bot manually in any issue comment:

- `/ai` â†’ full AI response
- `/summarize` â†’ summarize the issue
- `/classify` â†’ classify the issue type
- `/suggest` â†’ propose solutions

If no command is provided, the bot will **auto-comment on all new issues**.

### Step 3: Outputs & Labels

- The AI-generated comment is stored in the `ai_response` output.
- Suggested labels (`Bug`, `Feature`, `Question`) are stored in `ai_label` and applied automatically to the issue.
- Severity estimation is included in the comment for human reference.
